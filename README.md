# AI FAQ Chatbot 💬

This is a simple AI-powered FAQ Chatbot built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It simulates a chatbot interface where users can ask questions and receive a static response.  
This is the **half version** of the final project — the full version will use **React** and connect to **OpenAI's API** for real answers.
